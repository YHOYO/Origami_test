 About me:
 
 I have been folding origami since I was three years old, beginning with paper airplanes and other simple folds. Ever since then it has surfaced in my life in various ways. For my 6th birthday I recieved Origami Sea Life, a joint venture by artists John Montroll and Robert J. Lang, which was my first venture into complex origami beyond library books. Starting in elementary I sold my models for pocket change, which eventually worked into selling origami roses for school dances.

For my "Culminating Project" during senior year, I downloaded Robert J. Lang's TreeMaker program, and used that and the information in Origami Design Secrets to design my own origami models.

Now, after getting a physics degree from the University of Washington, I wanted to learn to program. The only project that I was interested in making was an extension of TreeMaker for designing models through a technique called "Box Pleating." Doing something this novel was initially beyond my ability, and I backed off to creating a TreeMaker clone in Python. Eventually, I would like to extend this to include Box Pleated models.

About Robert J. Lang
Robert J. Lang is one of the origami masters who has been leading innovation in the art for the past 35 years. He has advanced the art by publishing a large number of books of largely anitomically correct models, and has done a large portion of the formalization of origami design through mathematical methods. He has also applied his knowledge in the engineering world as a consultant, helping to design telescopes, airbags, and medical devices. 

He is the author of the computational origami design program TreeMaker, and several other computer programs. TreeMaker, now in version 5.01, is a program which allows the user to construct complete origami models for certain design styles, and compute the necessary folds to for the underlying structure.

He also has over 500 models models, 13 books, and multiple museum exhibitions.

TreeMaker and Circle/River Packing Theory

It's been more than five years since I read Origami Design Secrets, in full, so I need to remind myself of some of the core concepts.

Chapter 8: Tiling
There are a number of traditional bases in origami, such as the four pointed bird base (the starting point of the crane model),, the waterbomb base, the frog base, and others. These bases can be modified in a way called "grafting" where "extra" paper is put in between different sections of the base. Tiling is a way to look at the base and the grafting as two subsets of a unified strcture.

Uniaxial bases are bases where the edge of the paper lies upon a central axis. Another consequence is that all of the flaps flip up and down perpendicular to this axis. Creases that lie along the axis are named axial creases, and create a network of polygons called axial polyons when the paper is unfolded.

With a graft of paper in between the flaps on either side, a uniaxial base can be transformed into a dual axis base. Grafts can be viewed as a certain type of axial polygon.

Base design can be expanded by merging any axial polygons (or tiles) along their creases.
